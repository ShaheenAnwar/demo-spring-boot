H2 is an in-memory DB in Spring Boot. To use H2 in our SB project we can add it while creating the project in Spring initializer or add the dependency in 
pom.xml file:
	<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
	</dependency>
	
To enable H2 db we need to add cfg in application.properties file:
	spring.h2.console.enabled = true
	spring.datasource.platform = h2
	spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:mem:demo
	
	http://localhost:8080/h2-console
